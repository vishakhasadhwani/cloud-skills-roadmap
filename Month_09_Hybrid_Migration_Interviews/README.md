# Month 9: Hybrid + Migration Interview Questions

**Focus:** Migration case studies, hybrid connectivity design, and phased migration + cost frameworks.

**Common Technical Questions to Practice:**

| Question | Key Points |
|----------|------------|
| "We have 500 VMs on VMware. How would you migrate to cloud?" | Phased migration, hybrid period, cost analysis |
| "Database is on-prem for compliance. How do you architect cloud connectivity?" | VPN tunnels, Direct Connect/ExpressRoute, security |
| "Explain cloud vs on-prem vs hybrid trade-offs" | Balance, not "cloud solves everything" |
| "How do you deploy LLMs without breaking the budget?" | Ollama for dev, APIs for prod, caching |
| "Customer data can't leave EU. How do you build AI features?" | Self-hosted LLMs, EU-region cloud, on-prem inference |

**Practice Projects:**

- [ ] Create migration plan documentation for hypothetical 200-VM scenario
- [ ] Build VPN/Direct Connect demo architecture diagrams
- [ ] Create cost comparison spreadsheet (AWS vs Azure vs bare metal)
- [ ] Document GDPR-compliant AI architecture patterns
